      <p class="lead text-justify">Vermicomposting uses composting worms -- such as red worms -- to break down organic wastes into castings, aka black gold or worm poop. Currently, vermicomposting is a growing effort that has shown great innovation and scaleability.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <section class="col-sm-4">
        <h4>Organic Materials</h4>
        <p class="lead text-justify">When we say "organic materials," we mean the following waste can be added: food, leaves, grains, and natural cloths (such as cotton).
          <!--In traditional composting, you need to stock pile in preparation for the next "batch."-->
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="col-sm-4">
        <h4>Less Labor Intensive</h4>
        <p class="lead text-justify">Vermicomposting less labor intensive, as it requires little turning/aerating necessary because the worm activity helps to mix, fragment, and aerate waste.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="col-sm-4">
        <h4>Great For All Spaces</h4>
        <p class="lead text-justify">In addition, vermicomposting does not require as much space as traditional compost piles. It only requires a bin approximately 8 to 16 inches deep with 1 to 2 square feet of surface area.

        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="col-sm-4">
        <h4>In Perspective</h4>
        <p class="lead text-justify"> This means they can be contained in something as small as a Nature's Little Recyclers Mini-Bin, a five-gallon bucket, or a twenty-gallon bin, and thus creates the ability to have indoor systems. And when vermicomposting outdoors, the space used
          can grow as large as the Herdsman can feed the worms.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="col-sm-4">
        <h4>Can be done Year round</h4>
        <p class="lead text-justify">Weather is a key factor in composting. Traditional composting methods slow down in very cold weather, but vermicomposting allows for true year round composting.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="col-sm-4">
        <h4>The Advantages of this</h4>
        <p class="lead text-justify">Since vermicomposting can be done in indoor spaces, it is spared any inclement weather and can be done year-round. With the ability to continuously feed Nature's Little Recyclers can feed their outside vermicomposting systems year round through
          innovative practice.</p>
