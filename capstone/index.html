    <p class="lead text-justify">Vermicomposting uses composting worms -- such as red worms -- to break down organic wastes into castings, aka black gold or worm poop. Currently, vermicomposting is a growing effort that has shown great innovation and scaleability.</p>
    <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>Less Labor Intensive:</strong> When we say "organic materials," we mean the following waste can be added: food, leaves, grains, and natural cloths (such as cotton). In traditional composting, you need to stock pile in preparation for the next
      "batch." Vermicomposting, however, is less labor intensive, as it requires little turning/aerating necessary because the worm activity helps to mix, fragment, and aerate waste.</p>
    <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>Great for Both Small or Large Spaces:</strong> In addition, vermicomposting does not require as much space as traditional compost piles. It only requires a bin approximately 8 to 16 inches deep with 1 to 2 square feet of surface area. This
      means they can be contained in something as small as a Nature's Little Recyclers Mini-Bin, a five-gallon bucket, or a twenty-gallon bin, and thus creates the ability to have indoor systems. And when vermicomposting outdoors, the space used can grow
      as large as the Herdsman can feed the worms.</p>
    <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>Can Be Done Year Round:</strong>Weather is a key factor in composting. Traditional composting methods slow down in very cold weather, but vermicomposting allows for true year round composting. Since vermicomposting can be done in indoor spaces,
      it is spared any inclement weather and can be done year-round. With the ability to continuously feed, Nature's Little Recyclers can feed their outside vermicomposting systems year round through innovative practice.</p>
