    <h1 class="display-4">Open-Bin Composting</h1>
    <p class="lead text-justify">Open bins are an excellent way to do hot or cold composting, which makes this option my favorite. These types of bins typically use either wire fencing or wood to create a neat, structured area to stockpile your organic matter. The openness of the
      bin (or bins) allows for easy turning and harvesting of materials (especially if you have removable front pieces) and for air to enter and circulate, speeding up decomposition. The bins are easy to build and can accommodate large volumes. Having
      multiple bins allows the easy transfer of materials from one bin to another when hot composting. Open bins also keep compost materials tidy and partially hidden from view, making the area less of an eyesore for you and your neighbors.</p>
    <p class="lead text-justify">Cost, however, can vary. The least expensive open bin is a single unit made from stakes and wire fencing or poultry netting, costing roughly $25 for materials, plus a few hours of labor to construct it. The ultimate three-bin system (the Cadillac
      of composters for hot composting) is approximately 12 feet long and 4 feet wide with each compartment being 4 feet square. It can run between $500 and $2,000 to construct. Your total cost may vary depending on whether you use recycled-plastic lumber
      or wood.</p>
