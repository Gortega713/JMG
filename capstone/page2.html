    <h1 class="display-4">Pit-Composting</h1>
    <p class="lead text-justify">For pit composting, holes or trenches are dug to bury your waste. After that, you sit back and forget about it, while the organic materials gradually break down over a period of six months to a year. This method is effective for those who want their
      decomposing organic matter to be completely out of sight. The trench is also a good place to stick those weedy plants you have pulled up. If buried deep enough, the weed seeds will not see the light of day, so they wonâ€™t resprout.</p>
    <p class="lead text-justify">The hole or trench is awkward to harvest, though, so it is probably best used to enrich an area you ultimately want to plant in. This method comes at no cost but requires extra labor for digging.</p>
    at a reasonable cost.</p>
