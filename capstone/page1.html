      <p class="lead text-justify">Closed bins are usually made from recycled plastic and can come in different shapesâ€”from square to cylindrical. All options have a lid to cover the container. These bins are a good cold-composting choice for urban and suburban locations. They do,
        however, present some difficulties. They cannot be used for hot composting, for example, because the closed bin makes it difficult to maintain the required temperature. The containers also hold a limited volume of material.</p>

        <h4>Important</h4>
        <p class="lead text-justify">Harvesting from a closed bin can be challenging because the openings are only about 1 foot above soil level. To make the job easier, you can move the entire unit to another spot. These bins typically have no bottom, so the compost materials will
          drop out when you lift the bin. Fork what is at the top of the compost pile into the new bin location, and harvest what has decomposed on the bottom. Closed bins typically run between $50 and $250. Municipalities sometimes offer this version
          to residents at a reasonable cost.</p>
